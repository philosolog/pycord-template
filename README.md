# What is this?
A template repository that I'll use for my future Python-based Discord bot creations. Feel free to use it as you wish.

Suggestions and improvements are greatly appreciated!
# Usage
- Get the [requirements](https://guide.pycord.dev/installation) from the terminal:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Edit/assign values in `.env`.
  - Set up `alternate.env` if you want to run a test-bot.
