# What's this?
A template repository that I made for my [Pycord](https://pycord.dev)-based Discord bot creations. Feel free to use this template as you wish.

Suggestions and improvements are greatly appreciated!
# Usage
## Setup
- Get the [requirements](https://guide.pycord.dev/installation) from the terminal:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Edit/assign values in `.env`.
  - Set up `alternate.env` if you want to run a test-bot.
## Customization
Check out the [Pycord documentation](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/).
