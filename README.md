# a pycord template i made for myself (and maybe you)
- get the [requirements](https://guide.pycord.dev/installation) from the terminal (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- edit/assign the respective .env values
- alternate.env is for running a test-bot
- thanks for giving me reasons to learn pycord
